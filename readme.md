# Todo App

This is a simple todo application built with Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
Originally I was going to make an Api with Flask and use a React frontend, but I wanted to see how
well using just Flask/jinja would work. And i'm pretty pleased with the result. Kept it as simple as possible.
